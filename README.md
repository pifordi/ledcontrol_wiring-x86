# ledcontrol_wiring-x86
Select a pin and turn on/off it by using wiring-x86 on Intel Galileo which runs ubilinux(based on debian wheezy)

Intel Galileo is a board that runs limited-linux on it but you can boot the board via microSD card which has a full linux distribution. Emutex Labs create a linux distro based on debian wheezy is ubilinux. The installation is available on their web site. I also wrote a blog post about installing ubilinux on a microSD card and booting the board with ubilinux and then install required modules for examining pincontrol program on Python. Full blog post is here in Turkish.
